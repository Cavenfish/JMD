# JMD.jl

Julia Molecular Dynamics (JMD)

This package has been developed with the idea that I would be the only one using it. Since this package is used in my published research, I have made the repo public for the sake of transperancy. 

Some consequences of the "no one will use this code" mentality:
  
  - There is currently no documentation for anything in JMD.jl
  - JMD.jl is a bit bloated with niche code (specific to my use case)

I do plan on making a documentation, not because my mentality has changed and I expect this package to have many users, but because I want to learn how to make proper documentation with the Documentar.jl package. This is a work in progress (peep the docs branch), and the timeframe is non-existent.

If you do wish to use JMD.jl and the docs don't yet exist, then your best bet is to take a look at the scripts directory in the repo. I'll try to be proactive about adding scripts I use in my research into the directory.
